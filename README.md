# ARIMA and SARIMAX Time Series Forecasting

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook `ARIMA_and_SARIMAX.ipynb`, which demonstrates the application of ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables) models for time series analysis and forecasting. The notebook is designed to provide insights into effective strategies for modeling and predicting data that exhibits seasonal patterns.

## Project Description

The `ARIMA_and_SARIMAX.ipynb` notebook explores time series forecasting by:
- Introducing the concepts of ARIMA and SARIMAX models.
- Demonstrating the data preparation steps necessary for time series analysis.
- Implementing these models on sample datasets to forecast future data points.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

## Installation

To set up your local environment to run the notebook, follow these steps:

echo "Cloning the repository..."
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ARIMA_and_SARIMAX.git
cd ARIMA_and_SARIMAX

echo "Installing required Python packages..."
pip install -r requirements.txt

echo "Launching Jupyter Notebook..."
jupyter notebook

This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. Navigate to the `ARIMA_and_SARIMAX.ipynb` file and open it.

## Usage

You can run the notebook cells sequentially to understand the methodology and see the results of the ARIMA and SARIMAX models. Each cell in the notebook includes detailed comments explaining what the code does and its purpose in the analysis.
